The problem was solved by replicating the *compute* container.
Add the following snippet to the compute service in `docker-compose.yml`:

```
deploy:
  mode: replicated
  replicas: 3
```

Now the application works.

Full docker-compose.yml:
```
version: '3.2'
services:
  calculator:
      image: devopsdockeruh/scaling-exercise-calculator
      ports:
        - 3000:3000
      container_name: calculator
  compute:
      image: devopsdockeruh/scaling-exercise-compute
      environment:
        - VIRTUAL_HOST=compute.localtest.me
      deploy:
        mode: replicated
        replicas: 3
  load-balancer:
      build: ./load-balancer
      image: load-balancer
      volumes: 
        - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro
      ports:
        - 80:80
      container_name: load-balancer
```
